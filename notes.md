## Full-Stack Project
- The first tiem (but not last) we ask you to design an app from scratch
  - This is an opportunity to fill in the gaps in your knowledge: become more independent
- This is a lot more work than implementing a design we give you, so start early!

-------

## Project Advisor (PA)

### What to expect
1. Checkpoints: PA will schedule to exclusively meet with their mentees on **W8D2, W8D5, and W9D1 from 9-12**
  - TA's will monitor progess through GitHub issue/milestone completion in scheduled intervals

2. Aside from that, all TA's will be avaiable answering questions from all pods
3. Your PA will be strict and push you to further your own abilities
  - You and your PA will agree to a specific sset of MVP features to complete
  - Any incomplete feature will result in a job search strike

## You are a software developer
- From this point forwared, the curriculum has taught you everything you need to know to buld a Fullstack web applicaton and, more importantly, how to learn
- Software developers are alawaus referencing SO or the official documentation - so make that your first line of defense
- Y'all will become familiar with techniques and tech that others don't - ask each other for help
- Just like the Blue Bird, you can fly: the remainder of this curriculum is structured to make sure you soar


-------
## FrontEnd vs Backend

- Business logic: relationships, filtering, sorting & ordering
  - Rails/ActiveRecord/Postgres are very good at this
  - Don't do heavy processing on the front-end
    - Protect your store from holding unnecessary information

-----

## FrontEnd

- Display logic: Formatting json/model data so the user can view and iteract with it
  - Rails is okay at this
  - React

----

### How do we apply these principles?

1. Make wireframes first (User First)
2. Subdivide views into components based on the **data being displayed**
3. Components will display whatever's given to them by the store (Frontend/Backend)


-----

1. The Store will uncritically hold whatever the API gives it (Frontend/Backend).
  - Exception: reducers can modify the structure.
2. The API returns pre-filtered data via query params (Frontend/Backend).

## Reqirements for Prosopal

- MVP
- Design Docs
  - Wireframes
  - Component Hierachy
  - Sample State
  - API Endpoints
  - DB Schema
- GitHub Milestones / Issues


----
## MVP (Minimum Viable product)

- The MVP of your project should be a full-stack app
- 4 MVP's from checklist + Heroku hosting, Auth, Production README

----

## WireFrames
- Have detailed wireframes for every page
- Annotate every react component and child component
- This is probably the most important part of the proposal
  - And will save you the most time
- ..

----
## Component Hierarchy
- Your application's overal component stucture: How are they nested?
- ...

---

## Sample State
- Draft your state shape
- What information do your components need?
- How can it be organized to ease access and reduce duplication?
(Poor state design)

---
## API EndPoints (Routes)


---
## DB Schema
